## PCB Routing

This section documents the final PCB routing of the
Smart Irrigation System using ESP32.

The routing was completed after finalizing the component
placement to ensure short signal paths, good power integrity,
and a clean board layout.

### Routing Overview
- The PCB is a two-layer board (Top and Bottom copper)
- Signal routing was optimized to minimize crossovers
- Power and ground traces were kept short and wide
- Critical signals were routed with minimal length

### Layer Details
- routing_final.png  
  Shows the completed PCB routing and represents the
  final top copper layer view.

- routing_bottom_layer.png  
  Shows the routing on the bottom copper layer.

- routing_top_silkscreen.png  
  Shows the top silkscreen layer with component
  labels and reference designators.

### Final Notes
The routing was verified to ensure there are no unconnected
nets and the board is ready for Gerber generation and
fabrication.
