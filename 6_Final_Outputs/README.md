## Final PCB Outputs (2D & 3D)

This folder contains the final visual outputs of the
Smart Irrigation System PCB design.

### 2D PCB View
- final_2d_pcb.png shows the completed PCB layout
  including copper routing and silkscreen markings.

### 3D PCB View
- final_3d_pcb.png shows the 3D rendered view of the PCB
  generated using EasyEDA, representing the physical
  appearance of the board after fabrication.

These final outputs confirm that the PCB design is
complete, fabrication-ready, and mechanically verified.
