This folder contains the final Gerber files generated using EasyEDA
for the Smart Irrigation System PCB.

The Gerber files were generated after completing schematic design,
component placement, and PCB routing.

### Gerber Generation
- Tool used: EasyEDA
- Board type: 2-layer PCB
- All copper, silkscreen, solder mask, and drill layers
  are included in the Gerber ZIP file.

### Fabrication Ready
The Gerber files are fabrication-ready and can be directly
uploaded to PCB manufacturers such as JLCPCB.

These files represent the final manufacturing output of the project.
